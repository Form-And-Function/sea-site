          <p><strong>In this post, I propose that “things being similar” means someone can make some same predictions that they care about involving those things. Then, I argue that this (along with other stuff) implies empty / open individualism (or a version of it), which imply that person-affecting views are incoherent.</strong></p>

<p>What is Being Similar?</p>

<p>(Thinking about this question feels like it has helped me do better at thinking about theories of identity, which seem to have big implications for all kinds of stuff, including longtermist ethics. More on that in a bit.)</p>

<p>What do we mean when we say things are similar? This seems to be a label we apply very intuitively, but at least I would have had trouble explaining what I meant by it except by appealing to others’ intuitions. How could we understand similarity in meaningfully different terms?</p>

<p>One idea that might help is the notion that similar objects are clusters in thingspace: on a graph with many, many axes, each representing some property, and many, many points, each representing some object, then similar objects would form groups of points that are close together, because the quantities representing their characteristics are close together.</p>

<p>There’s several aspects of this I found confusing:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     -  Do axes also represent properties with discrete values? (e.g. "whether the height of this object is greater than 5 feet, represented by a value of 0 or 1")?

     -  If that is the case, it seems that, for any two objects, one could come up with infinite properties such that they would have the same value, and infinite properties such that they would have different values. With enough creativity, one could probably do something similar even with continuous properties. So everything is in a cluster with everything else, and nothing is. How can it make sense, then, to talk about clusters and similarity?

     -  What even is a property?

<p>What is Being Green?</p>

<p>Answering the last question, I think, helps make sense of the other ones. What are we talking about, when we talk about properties?</p>

<p>The best answer I can come up with is that, when we talk about properties of an object, we mean whatever can be truthfully said involving the object, and we usually care because these statements have predictive implications. (Except maybe normative properties, and properties involving objects that will no longer be relevant to prediction for weird space reasons.)</p>

<p>For example, when I say something is green, I mean things like: when I look at it (if there’s enough light), I will probably experience that which I call seeing green; honest people who look at it and describe it will probably describe it as green; if someone measured the wavelength of the light it reflects/emits, they would probably find that it is within some range I could look up; and if I knew enough about how atomic structures determine color, I could probably make predictions about that too. I don’t think there’s anything I mean by calling something “green” other than attributing to it this bundle of predictions. So properties, it seems, are (usually) what can be said about some thing that imply bundles of predictions involving that thing.</p>

<p>Back to: What is Being Similar?</p>

<p>With this in mind, drawing a sharp distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties doesn’t make much sense to me. Sharp distinctions are pretty sketchy in general.</p>

<p>Understanding properties as “things that can be truthfully said of objects with predictive implications” also seems to mean that qualities like time and position too are, rightfully, properties. Objects that are otherwise the same but exist in different places or times are, in important respects, different objects. This makes sense: if I am thinking about eating a carrot, it would be good to know whether the carrot is currently in China, or whether it existed 200 years in the past.</p>

<p>This helps answer the earlier question of why we would ever call things similar, when all things are similar in infinite ways and dissimilar in infinite ways. Some of the predictions I could make about stuff matter more to me than others, so for any particular set of purposes, it does make since to say that some things are similar. For the purposes of predicting how much stuff I can put in them, I can safely say the drawers next to me are similar. But for the purposes of predicting whether an arsonist who hates all objects at shin-bashing level would burn them, I would have to say they are different. (Fortunately, this is not a concern of mine.)</p>

<p>Judgement of similarity, then, is purpose (and therefore context)-dependent: it depends on which properties I care about, which results from which predictions I want to be able to make. Words, as has been argued, are well-used when they identify clusters of properties and thus cleave reality along its joints. More than that, they’re well-used when they identify properties I (rightfully) care about and thus cleave reality along the joints I care about.</p>

<p>Things are similar to me, then, to the extent that the predictions I can make involving each (insofar as these are predictions I care about) are the same.</p>

<p>I think this helps make sense of questions about identity.</p>

<p>What is Being Someone?</p>

<p>(As far as I’m aware, the following is largely a rehashing of what I got from Felipe’s summary of Parfit’s Reasons and Persons, Cole’s discussions of empty individualism, and the writings I’ll link below. But this is so paradigm-shifting that I think it’s worth repeating / rehashing, and the last bit about making happy people is something I haven’t seen written out.)</p>

<p>Empty and Open Individualism</p>

<p>With the above ideas in mind, I don’t see how it can make sense to think of two things, or two beings, as identical. If they were identical, it seems one would have had no reason to think about them as “two” in the first place. Anything is only identical to itself. So the notion of me-right-now being the same person as me-in-an-hour doesn’t make sense. Sure, me-right-now and me-in-an-hour are very similar, and we’re probably similar in ways that I’m not similar to those who would be more conventionally called “other people” (we’re very similar in our appearance, as well as in how much of our genetic code and memory we share). But we’re not the same, not quite. This is especially clear from looking at baby pictures: “There’s no way that’s me!” Of course not! Present-me and baby-me are different in lots of ways that matter to present-me. When you shorten the time difference from lifetime-since-baby to an hour, the differences don’t disappear; they just get smaller.</p>

<p>Still, it might seem that there’s something that remains constant throughout. Some personality traits? These may remain similar, but they still seem to change substantially (unless you’re using labels so broad that they obscure changes that do occur, but that’s cheating). A soul? It seems very difficult to make the case that the soul is both something eternal and unchanging as well as something equivalent to the mind, since the mind clearly changes (and I don’t know what it would mean to call something “eternal” if it’s changing). Some kind of constant, quiet observer behind it all? The essay mentioned above argues compellingly that we have no reason to think such an observer would be constant, that there’s anything about us “flowing” from one moment to the next at all. For the rest of this post, I’ll be working with that idea, so I recommend that essay if that doesn’t make sense yet. If you read that and you’re still confused, then maybe we’re all confused.</p>

<p>(Perhaps not relevantly: this rather long post by Eliezer argues compellingly that it would be absurd to think the “observer” mentioned in the last paragraph is quiet.)</p>

<p>These ideas resolve the paradox of the heap, the ship of Theseus, and the teletransportation paradox. In the first case, there is no heap, not as some fundamental concept with sharp boundaries; asking “at what point does it stop/start being a heap?” wrongly assumes this distinction happens at a point rather than over a long gradient. The latter two cases stop being confusing once one drops the idea of “fundamental sameness over time.” Sure, it’s (nearly) the same ship/person, but this means nothing more than a high degree of similarity across two different things.</p>

<p>This post (which is also quite long, and involves a lot of sketchy physics, and comes from an author who doesn’t exactly scream credibility) convinced me that the most important thing current-me shares with me-a-second-from-now, whether it’s continuity of experience of experience itself, is something I share with every other sentient being that ever was and will be. Isn’t that cool?</p>

<p>As I understand them:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     -  Empty individualism (described in the two paragraphs at the start of this section) focuses on how I am different from other people, and concludes that, in a significant way, "my" past and future selves are also other people.

     -  Open individualism (described in that sketchy blog), on the other hand, focuses on how I am the same as my past and future self, and concludes that, in a significant way, "other people" are also myself.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These seem to be, not two conflicting ideas, but two sides of the same coin. Sameness and difference, as we saw before, depend on what one cares about, and this is just as true for beings as it is for things.</p>

<p>Either way, to the extent that I am, I am immortal, and so are you–just not as immortality is conventionally imagined. If experience somehow does mystically flow over (beyond?) time and space, it seems far from clear that it would stop along with “death” rather than continuing to flow to the next most similar thing, and “wake up” as we think we do after sleep. Or, less mystically, if the flow of experience is a confusion created by the general continuity of memory, then the notion of it “coming to an end” is incoherent, and in some sense every moment always is. I still feel very confused by this concept. At least, I don’t have good words for it, since the way in which it seems that “every moment always is” is not in the sense of “existing at all times,” although that’s how the word “always” usually works. So I don’t quite know what I mean by this.</p>

<p>Making Happy People</p>

<p>More relevantly to EA, empty individualism means that asking “is our responsibility towards people who could come to exist the same as it is for people who are alive right now?” is incoherent (and not only because “could” seems to be an expression of uncertainty, which utilitarianism already discounts). We can not help people who are alive right now, because our actions are not instantaneous. We can only help people who could be alive later. Maybe even people who could exist very soon and be very similar to people alive right now, sure, but not “the same people at a later time,” because those would not be the same people, not in any sense that seems at all relevant to ethical thinking. One can’t even predict who will exist in the future, since multitudes of minute factors will affect precisely who comes to be at any particular time. If particular beings only exist for minute slices of time, then the only people we can help are people who might come to be, and the only way we can help them is by making happy (or preference-satisfied, or whatever) beings as opposed to miserable ones come to be.</p>

<p>By this, I do not mean causing / preventing the literal birth of such beings; I mean the seemingly smaller ways in which we cause and prevent the existence of beings all the time. When you tell a sad friend a joke, you are not uplifting “the same person”; you are bringing into being a happier person when otherwise there would have been a sadder person. And all potentially-ethical choices are, necessarily, these kinds of choices–choices about which possible people to bring into being. So asking whether utilitarianism ought to be about “making people happy” or “making happy people” doesn’t make sense. “Making people happy” is “making happy people.”</p>

<p>(Open individualism also suggests something along these lines, because it also rejects the importance of the conventional boundaries between beings, which person-affecting views seem to require.)</p>

<p>I suspect that empty/open individualism have lots of other big implications for questions that matter to us, and that many remain unexplored.</p>
