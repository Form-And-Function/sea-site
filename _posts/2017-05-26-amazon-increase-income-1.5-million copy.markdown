**I’ve been reading Rationality A to Z for the past three months or so and I’ve been training myself to notice more my thoughts, beliefs, actions, and emotions. One consequence of this has been that I noticed that there are categories that my thoughts often fall into—the first category I noticed was “Questions I want answers to.” When I realized how useful it would be to write down all of the “Questions I want answers to,” I made a google document named “Questions I want answers to” which now has ~20 questions I want answers to, two of which I’ve been able to mostly answer, with notes about each question.**

But as I’ve noticed my thoughts more, I created more and more docs, such as “Oops” (for things I was mistaken about), “Models” (for the important ways I think about the world or for when I update one of these ways of thinking), “Productivity Tips,” “Projects,” “High value things I need to do,” “Quotes I like,” “Predictions,” “Ideas,”  etc.

This has been incredibly useful, mostly because I’m only caching the more useful thoughts (with some exceptions of course 😃). Now every time I think of one of these things, and I think of something cool or I realize I need to do something, I can easily keep track of it. 

Though I’m embarrassed to say that I am only JUST NOW making a doc for “Career thoughts” when I think about it so often. -->
