**Meta-EA seems quite neglected in the EA community to me currently (compared to my estimate of how it would look in an ideal world, but I don’t have really strong credence on this). This is particularly the case among people who are currently/planning on working on EA full time. What really lit the fire under me to start addressing this issue was thinking about the 80K survey of top EA organizations that across the board reported that they were primarily talent/people-constrained rather than funding constrained. My initial thought was that this is a clear sign of meta-EA/community building failing to do its job well. This then naturally led to the question of how to best address this bottleneck of the EA community (and there are pretty clear arguments/evidence for this being the biggest bottleneck of all within EA). .**

Thinking about how to best address the talent constraint, universities seem extremely promising. Where else do you find such a high concentration of very talented, hard-working, caring individuals who:

1) Do not yet have career plans

2) Are explicitly trying to figure out the answer to the question “What should I do with my life?” 

3) Even if they have ideas/tentative plans, are very open to updating career plans/beliefs/etc

 Side note 1: This willingness to update is likely to drastically decrease very quickly over time, since the costs of changing career trajectories becomes much higher after university (at least in peoples’ minds), and likely even just after deciding what to major in since people feel they ought to enter a career somewhat related to what they study. All of this to say that the window for the ideal time to be introduced to EA (in terms of the impact that introducing EA to someone can have) is probably not very long. Willingness to update is also probably significantly tied to ability to change majors/programs. U.S. EA groups seem particularly well situated to cause significant counterfactual career changes since students aren’t locked in on their program when (as opposed to the UK/Canada for example), but I definitely think these arguments apply to universities everywhere.

 Side note 2: Maybe late high school is something else to consider more seriously. I know there were EA forum posts about high school outreach not working out super well, but I’m not convinced that the examples provided were ideal (building relationships with teachers, being a teacher yourself, etc. seem more promising than some of the things SHIC tried, but I’d have to think more about this point. I’ve also had decent success talking to high-schoolers about EA, but don’t have enough data/there hasn’t been enough time to tell if people excited after my presentations/conversations would actually plan on pursuing EA/high-impact careers more seriously a few years down the line). 

Thus it seems to me that having really good/high-volume meta-EA work happening at university EA groups could be very beneficial if done well in producing lots of highly dedicated, knowledgeable EAs to fill in gaps and do a lot of good. It also seems to me that most if not all groups are still operating significantly below capacity and could/would be doing much more if the value in doing so were clearer/more legible.  

I would guess that CEA specifically has a unique platform to address this imbalance. I imagine at least a few people at universities would update significantly if CEA were to present more thoughts/data on the effectiveness and importance meta-EA so I thought that was worth mentioning, especially given how high-impact community building at universities is in expected value for the EA community. 

I’m sure you’ve already given this topic a lot more thought than I have, but I thought it would be useful to share my thoughts as someone who has recently become quite serious about meta-EA work for the foreseeable future and think it could do EA a ton of good if there were hard-core meta EA people at all high-potential groups (universities and cities mainly, but maybe for cause areas as well, as David Nash discussed here).

Arguments that made meta-EA work feel emotionally compelling:

The thought of doubling your impact through just a few really high-quality conversations is extremely compelling, as is the thought of finding the next Will MacAskill/Nick Bostrom/etc. The number of hours required on average to get someone to pursue a full-time EA career compared to the 80,000 hours in your own career makes the case even more compelling (especially when considering you are likely to get better at this with practice). 

In a similar vein, I’ve been reflecting on what got me motivated to pursue EA community building and what was (cognitively) preventing me from doing so before. I think the main reasons I previously didn’t consider Meta-EA as the cause area I personally wanted to focus on are:

The opportunity cost/other opportunities that might be a better fit given my technical background

But when thinking about marginal impact it seems to be the case that a lot of the most talented people want to go into direct work and very few are trying to find other very talented people to also do the work/focusing on meta-EA.

Long-term prospects/career capital not seeming too promising (at least based on the current scene)

Prestige/status/money/respect within/outside the EA community

The status/prestige/’sexiness’ aspect of what to do with your career seems to play a bigger part in EA’s career plans than we’d care to admit, and being honest with ourselves about how much we do and should value the aforementioned things compared to impact seems to make the choice a lot more clear in many cases (it definitely did for me).

Not much coverage/emphasis of Meta-EA/community building as a career option in 80K and other EA platforms (and not enough persuasive arguments making the case for community building/meta-EA in 80K materials, since the career options aren’t very well laid out at the moment)

It not being intellectually interesting

As I get more involved in community building I realize this doesn’t have to be the case. Being a good community builder means being generally abreast of EA research/community and having deep, well informed/thought out mental models which requires lots of thinking and reading cool things to be able to be a good signpost, do intro/advanced/career 1:1s well, etc.

If EA is able to address these concerns I think many students like me would be a lot more eager to invest more effort into community building/meta-EA and consider it more seriously. (You also don’t want to make it too appealing or risk falling into the meta-trap, but that doesn’t seem like something EA would have to worry about for a while?)
