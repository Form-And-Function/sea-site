**The Arete Fellowship is an opportunity to learn to maximize the positive impact of your life by studying key concepts in effective altruism, discussing them with a cohort of passionate students, and receiving access to career coaching, major advice, and networking opportunities.**

Its workload is equivalent to that of a 1-unit class. In the 2020-2021, the Fellowship will be offered in autumn quarter, and again in winter quarter. To apply for the 2020 fall Fellowship, please fill out this form by 11:59 pm on September 21.
