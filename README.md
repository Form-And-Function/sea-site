To start your project, fork this repository
After forking the repo, your site will be live immediately on your personal Github Pages account, e.g. `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled for your repo. It might take some time for the site to propagate entirely.

- Theme General Settings ( name, logo, email, phone, address )
- Hero Section
- About Section
- Team Section
- Skills Section
- Experience Section

## Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.
I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
