We are a community of Stanford students unified by a common desire to do the most we can to improve the world. We like to challenge our assumptions as we learn from one another, and to support one another in becoming the best versions of ourselves. 

Through regular reading and discussion meetups, skill-building workshops, social events, global networking opportunities, career coaching, academic advice, and more, we help students build the skills, knowledge, and connections to do incredible amounts of good for the world.
